DAT6 - Project Proposal

#NAME?

I hope to be able to determine a number of factors that contribute to the resonance of Tweets issued 
by members of violent extremist organizations.
Revision: I particularly want to look at the consumption and behavioral habits of VEO-affiliated users

#NAME?

"Twitter metadata, pulled from the Twitter API "
"Revision: Perhaps just export a data set from one of the social media monitoring tools that I use at work (Scraawl, Sysomos, etc.)"

#NAME?

I know that I am going to need a large data set and that I will likely need to use multiple API keys 
to make enough data calls (due to call limitations).

Revision: I imagine that at least 6 months of Tweets would be enough to establish a worthwhile trend.

#NAME?

It's related to my line of work and behavioral psychology fascinates me.
