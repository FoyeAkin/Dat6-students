DAT6 - Project Proposal

- What is the question you hope to answer? 

I hope to be able to determine a number of factors that contribute to the resonance of Tweets issued 
by members of violent extremist organizations.


- What data are you planning to use to answer that question? 

Twitter metadata, pulled from the Twitter API


- What do you know about the data so far? 

I know that I am going to need a large data set and that I will likely need to use multiple API keys 
to make enough data calls (due to call limitations).


- Why did you choose this topic?

It's related to my line of work and behavioral psychology fascinates me.
