# Course Project

## Question
For my final project, I'm planning use data build a model that will forecast Metro rail ridership. 

## Motivation
I'm interested in topics relating to transportation, urban planning, and more generally, about how people move around a city and what form of transportation they will use. The visualization of the Metro ridership data will also be a very interesting exercise. 

## Data
### Historic Metrorail ridership data
WMATA provides [historic ridership data](http://www.wmata.com/pdfs/planning/Historical%20Rail%20Ridership%20By%20Station.pdf) on their website by station and year from 1977 to 2011. It is unfortunately provided in PDF format. 

But luckily, Code for DC also has [historic ridership data](http://www.opendatadc.org/dataset/wmata-metrorail-ridership-by-date) for every day in the last 10 years. It is in a much more palatable csv form. The data is clean and simple. It only has two columns: One for the date and the other is number of riders. It appears that the number of riders have been rounded off to the near hundred thousand. 

### Data for factors affecting ridership
* Fare prices: You can get this data from the WMATA website

* Gas prices: The US Energy Information Administration has [historic gas prices](http://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.cfm?sid=US#PricesExpenditures) for every state from 1970-2012. The data just lists the year and the average price that year. Simple and clean data. 

* DC employment figures: The US Bureau of Labor Statistics provide historical [labor force data](http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.dc_washington_md.htm) for the DC metro area

* Tourist numbers: Smithsonian has [data](http://dashboard.si.edu/at-the-smithsonian) on number of visitors but only by year. DC's tourist website has data on their [PDF presentations](http://washington.org/press/DC-information/washington-dc-visitor-research) but not in any other form. 

* Weather?: Historical weather data is easy to find but I'm unsure if this will affect ridership.
